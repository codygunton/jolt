## Core Concepts

### Mathematical Foundations
- **Multilinear Extensions (MLEs)**: Polynomial extensions over boolean hypercubes that enable efficient evaluation and manipulation of discrete functions
- **Sum-check Protocol**: Interactive proof system for verifying polynomial evaluations across exponentially large domains
- **Eq Polynomial**: Special multilinear extension used for equality checking in cryptographic protocols

### Cryptographic Protocols
- **GKR Protocol**: SNARK system for arithmetic circuits, particularly optimized for multiplication trees in Jolt
- **Offline Memory Checking**: Technique for verifying read/write memory operations without online authentication
- **Batched Openings**: Optimization for combining multiple polynomial commitment scheme openings into single proofs

### System Architecture
- **RISC-V ISA**: Target instruction set architecture that Jolt proves, supporting RV32IM (base integer + multiplication/division)
- **Compilation Pipeline**: Integration with LLVM infrastructure for compiling high-level languages to provable RISC-V code

## Key Algorithms

### MLE Operations (`multilinear-extensions.md:10-32`)
- **Single Variable Binding**: O(n) algorithm for fixing one variable in an MLE
- **Multi Variable Binding**: O(n) evaluation at arbitrary field points using sequential binding

### Memory Verification (`memory-checking.md:15-47`)
- **Multiset Permutation Check**: Verifies read/write memory consistency using homomorphic hashing
- **Timestamp-based Ordering**: Ensures memory operations follow causal ordering constraints

### Interactive Proofs (`sumcheck.md:12-24`)
- **Round-by-round Protocol**: Reduces verification of exponential-size sums to single point evaluations
- **Degree Checking**: Ensures prover cannot cheat by sending high-degree polynomials

## Implementation Details

### Performance Optimizations
- Batched polynomial openings reduce verification costs
- Binary tree multiplication gates simplify GKR applications
- Single-pass MLE binding algorithms minimize memory overhead

### Security Properties
- Sound against polynomial-time adversaries under discrete log assumptions
- Complete for honest provers following protocol specifications
- Zero-knowledge through randomization of intermediate values

## Usage in Jolt

### Protocol Integration
1. **Bytecode Verification**: Uses read-only memory checking for program code
2. **Instruction Execution**: Applies lookup arguments with batched openings
3. **RAM Operations**: Implements read-write memory checking with timestamps
4. **Constraint Satisfaction**: Employs GKR for arithmetic circuit verification

### Compilation Support
- LLVM backend generates RISC-V code from C/C++/Rust/other languages
- Standard library support through cross-compilation toolchains
- Debug information preservation for better error reporting

## Development Notes

### File Relationships
- `sumcheck.md` provides foundation for `gkr.md` protocols
- `multilinear-extensions.md` defines data structures used throughout
- `eq-polynomial.md` describes specific MLE used in multiple contexts
- `memory-checking.md` builds on concepts from other files

### Implementation Considerations
- All protocols assume finite field arithmetic over large prime fields
- Polynomial degrees must be carefully managed for efficiency
- Random challenges must be sampled from sufficient entropy sources
