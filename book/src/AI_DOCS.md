## Key Concepts

### Jolt zkVM Framework
Jolt is a zero-knowledge virtual machine framework built around the Lasso lookup argument, enabling succinct proofs of program execution for any high-level language that compiles to RISC-V.

### Core Features
- **High-level Language Support**: Works with any language that compiles to RISC-V
- **Simple Programming Model**: Only 50-100 LOC needed for new VM instructions
- **State-of-the-art Performance**: Optimized prover with substantial growth potential
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed to support any instruction set architecture

### Technical Architecture
- **RISC-V Target**: Currently implements RV32IM instruction set
- **Decomposable Instructions**: Each primitive instruction can be broken into chunk operations
- **Lookup Arguments**: Extensive use of Lasso for efficient verification
- **Sumcheck-based SNARK**: Multivariate polynomial commitment schemes

## Implementation Details

### Compilation Pipeline
- LLVM-based compilation from high-level languages to RISC-V
- Standard library support through cross-compilation
