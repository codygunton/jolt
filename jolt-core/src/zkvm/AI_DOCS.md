# ZKVM Component - AI Documentation

## Overview

The `zkvm` module is the core zero-knowledge virtual machine implementation of the Jolt system. It provides a complete RISC-V 32-bit instruction set (RV32IM) zero-knowledge proof system for verifiable computation. The module implements the Jolt zkVM protocol as described in the academic paper, providing efficient zero-knowledge proofs for RISC-V program execution.

## Architecture

The ZKVM is structured around several key components that work together to create and verify zero-knowledge proofs:

### Core Components

- **Proof Generation**: Main entry point through the `Jolt` trait
- **Instructions**: Complete RV32IM instruction set implementation with virtual extensions
- **Lookup Tables**: Optimized lookup tables for cryptographic operations
- **Witnesses**: Polynomial witness generation for proof construction
- **R1CS**: Rank-1 constraint system for arithmetic circuits
- **DAG**: Directed acyclic graph for proof orchestration
- **RAM/Registers**: Memory and register management with consistency checks

```rust
// Preprocessing
let preprocessing = JoltRV32IM::prover_preprocess(
    bytecode, 
    memory_layout, 
    init_memory, 
    max_trace_length
);

// Prove
let (proof, io_device, debug_info) = JoltRV32IM::prove(
    &preprocessing, 
    &mut program, 
    &inputs, 
    None
);

// Verify
let verifier_preprocessing = JoltVerifierPreprocessing::from(&preprocessing);
let result = JoltRV32IM::verify(
    &verifier_preprocessing, 
    proof, 
    io_device, 
    debug_info
);
```
